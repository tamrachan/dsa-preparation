## Patterns
Found that Algomaster is the best YT channel for tutorials on concepts. Do one pattern per day.  
### Day 1: Two pointers
[YT: Two Pointers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzZ7nmouLTI)

#### Types of pointers
1. Converging pointers - use case: palindromes/reverse
2. Parallel pointers - use case: sliding window
3. Trigger based pointers - use case: linked lists (e.g. obtaining the fourth node from the back)

#### When to use?
Questions that contain arrays, strings and linked lists.  
Keywords to look out for: arrays that are SORTED, questions that ask to **return indices/pairs**.
#### Questions to practice:

EASY
- Contains duplicate
- Two Sum variants
- Move Zeros
- Valid Anagram
- Isomorphic Strings
- Remove duplicates  

MEDIUM
- 3Sum
- 3Sum closest
- Container with most water
